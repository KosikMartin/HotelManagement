# HotelManagement
Sample project I've made. It's a simple hotel management application used for making reservations. It's not meant to be used in commerce, but it definitely can be modified to enable that. Since I'm using the .csv file format to store the data and JTable to modify/display them, this makes it possible to integrate it into an SQL database.
